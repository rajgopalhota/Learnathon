# Hackathon Website

## Introduction
Welcome to our hackathon website! Our website was built in just 48 hours using Django, a high-level Python web framework that enables rapid development of secure and maintainable websites1. Our website contains a posting marks section for faculty and students can check their timetable attendance scores and more.

This is a website for the upcoming hackathon event. It provides information about the event, registration details, and other relevant information.

## Notes

Notes:
1. Make changes in settings.py

2. Set debug = False

3. (Important) run the command -> python manage.py collectstatic
    This will create a static folder which helps you to make your website use the CSS even after setting debug = False

4. Changed timezone in settings.py
